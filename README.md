# Mise En Place
> Generate recipes based on ingredients
Mise En Place is a web application that generates recipes based on ingredients in your fridge and maximizes the usage of those and reduces waste. It queries over 5,000+ recipes and finds the perfect one for you to cook. It compiles all the recipes that you love in one location and has a quick search for those who need to find a meal to cook. It also has a complex search that can filter recipes by cuisine, meal, intolerance, and diet for those picky eaters.

This project utilizes React, JavaScript and Material-UI for the frontend and UI design. Python, DjangoREST Framework and SQLite for the backend and database.

It is deployed on AWS EC2 using Nginx and Gunicorn
